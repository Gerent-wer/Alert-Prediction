## Urkraine Air Alarm Alert Prediction SaaS University Project 

#### Proffesor: Andrew Kurochkin

* Our team is consisted of Voitishyn Mykyta, Ivashenko Dima, Zubko Stanislav and Azhniuk Roman

#### Endpoint

* Ready Python SaaS which is capable of generating probability of air alarm in all regions of Ukraine every hour for next 12 hours


#### How to use

* 6_hourly_alert_prediction_generator.py - our end-point solution

* This file is exectuted every hour and returns prediction of air alarms for next 12 hours

* Also our project structure is build on step-by-step principle.
That means you should run scripts exactly one after another: during this process you will generate all necessary files and models for further purposes.

#### Why

* The most important reason: this project can be easily considered as a real-world and useful for Ukrainian people. In the end we made ready SaaS solution, which can be used by anyone to make their lives easier and safer.

#### Overview

* Python SaaS to predict the probability of air alarm for whole country based on the news (ISW reports), weather, past air alarms and the situation in the other regions. 


#### Problem statement

* Develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the likelihood of a air alarm in a given region based on a combination of data sources, including air alarms data, weather data, and war articles data.
The challenge is to design an algorithm that can effectively analyze these diverse data sources and identify patterns and trends that may be indicative of a potential outcome.
The model must be able to adapt to changing conditions and accurately predict the likelihood of air alarm in near real-time, allowing users to take appropriate actions to prepare for or respond to the situation.

#### How

* Python for Data science

    * Natural language preprocessing
    * Exploratary data analysis
    * Pandas manipulations(Ñ‡mostly with DataFrames)
    * Data Modeling
    * Machine lerning algorithms and predictions
    
* Web scraping and prepocessing    


* SaaS implementation

    * Running Amazon EC2 server
    * Creating PostMan collections

* GIT 

    * Pushing, pulling, working on the same project with a team
