1. Dataset for training is still too big in university project purposes, if the we are considered to 
train the model on our home devices.Wasted a lot of time waiting the model - but maybe it’s 
the lesson for use be more careful when preparing the data before fitting it. I would also 
suggest myself to review the features, size, way of merging.
2. Review existing features, think about new ones
3. Research for new models, which haven’t used yet
4. In general,I suppose useful thing to do is to try supply ISW war reports with another type of 
war articles/news.
5. Review the whole code logic within the Alarm prediction project, especially on NLP and data 
preprocessing part - in my opinion, for now it’s quite easy to make an transparent mistake
6. How we can decrease the size of dataset and in the same way don’t lose the accuracy 
significantly?
